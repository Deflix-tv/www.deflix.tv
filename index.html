               you can request the service to download it for you and it will do so in the background. Afterwards it's
               instantly available again for 15/30 days.</p>

            <p>Frequently asked questions</p>
         </header>
         <details>
            <summary>What does "Deflix" mean?</summary>
            <p><em>Deflix</em> stands for <em>debrid flicks</em>.</p>
            <p><em>Flick</em> is informal for <em>motion
                  picture</em>. And the flicks are streamed via a <em>debrid service</em> (see below).</p>
         </details>
         <details>
            <summary>What is a debrid service / MOCH?</summary>
            <p>Debrid services like <a href="https://real-debrid.com" target="_blank">RealDebrid ↗</a>, <a
                  href="https://premiumize.me" target="_blank">Premiumize.me ↗</a> and <a href="https://alldebrid.com"
                  target="_blank">AllDebrid ↗</a> mainly do two things:</p>
            <ol>
               <li>They <em>cache</em> the files from torrents.<br>
                  So instead of having to slowly download a torrent by yourself (which also uploads it at the same
                  time), you can <em>directly</em> download the files from a torrent from their servers via HTTP,
                  without uploading anything. This also means you can stream movies in 4k from them!
               </li>
               <li>They act as <em>MOCH</em> (Multi One-Click Hoster).<br>
                  This means you can use your debrid service account's credentials to access OCHs like MEGA,
                  uploaded.net, Rapidgator and many others.
               </li>
            </ol>

            <summary>What is Stremio? And what's its advantage over Kodi?</summary>
            <p><a href="https://www.stremio.com/" target="_blank">Stremio ↗</a> is a modern media center that's a
               one-stop solution for your video entertainment. You discover, watch and organize video content from easy
               to install addons.</p>
            <p>These addons run remotely as a web service, so they can't do any harm to your computer. This is different
               from how addons work for Kodi for example, where they run locally on your computer and have dozens of
               third party dependencies. There have been several security incidents with Kodi addons like <a

                  target="_blank">this one ↗</a> and even the Kodi developers themselves <a

         </details>
         <details id="danger">
            <summary>Why is torrenting dangerous?</summary>
            <p>When you download a torrent with a torrent software like µTorrent or qBittorrent, or even when you stream
               a torrent with a <em>torrent addon</em> for
               Stremio, your computer will upload the torrent via the BitTorrent P2P network at the same time.</p>
            <p>If you don't use a VPN, this exposes your IP address to the other participants in the network. So a
               lawyer hired by a movie company can see that you download their movie, note your IP address, get a court
               order with that "evidence" (many courts judge that the collected info is enough) and with that ask your
               ISP (Internet service provider) for your identity. The ISPs have to comply in this case because they're
               legally required to do so.</p>
            <p>In many cases this only leads to a warning at first and later to the ISP cutting off your Internet if you
               don't comply. But in some cases it can also lead to a lawsuit, fines etc. It depends on the country you
               live in.</p>
         </details>
         <details id="safe">
            <summary>Is streaming from a debrid service safe?</summary>
            <p>When not using a VPN, you're only exposing your IP address to the debrid service you're using. Without a
               court order, a lawyer can't request IP addresses of the service's users from that service. And without
               any "evidence" (like a lawyer seeing IP addresses in the BitTorrent network downloading movies) the
               lawyer doesn't get a court order. The only risk is the debrid service openly cooperating with lawyers and
               freely giving out information about its users without proper court orders.</p>
         </details>
         <details>
            <summary>How do you make money?</summary>
            <p>We don't make any money with this. We don't display ads anywhere and don't sell any premium access.
               Currently our costs are fairly low and are comprised only of running several servers across several cloud
               providers and paying for the domain.
            </p>
            <p>If our costs rise due to an increased amount of users and required infrastructure, we'll first try to
               compensate that with donations via Bitcoin.</p>
            <p>If that's not enough we'll try to partner with companys that might benefit from our service, like debrid
               services or Stremio.</p>
            <p>If that's still not enough we'll try to find another way in collaboration with you, our users, and the
               wider community if possible.</p>
